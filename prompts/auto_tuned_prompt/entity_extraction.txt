-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

 early debut has a strong positive short-term effect on research productivity in terms of both quantity and quality, and the positive effect amplifies with the increasing time span of the final award between first-movers and late-comers. However, the strong positive effect on long-term productivity presents only in the three- and four-year early debuts. These results suggest that the productivity gains of young scientists with an early debut tend to decrease over time. The significant gap between first-movers and three-, and four-year late-comers in the long term demonstrates a time threshold which distinguishes scientists' long-term research productivity. In addition, we find that the research productivity gap can be explained by the expanding research network and increasing funding opportunities. • We examine the impact of an early debut on scientists by comparing first-movers and late-comers in early career funding. • Early debut improves the short-term research productivity of first-movers, both in quantity and quality. • The productivity gains of young scientists with an early debut tend to diminish in the long term. • The impact of an early debut on first-movers relative to late-comers amplifies with the increasing span of final award.

 growth setting, our model also generates rich dynamics of economic booms, slowdowns, crashes, and recoveries. 

The paper titled 'quantifying the impact of red tape on investment: a survey data approach.' discusses: An important strand of research in macro-finance investigates which factors impede enterprise investment, and what is their aggregate economic cost. In this paper, we make two contributions to this literature. The first contribution is methodological: we introduce a novel framework to calibrate macroeconomic models with firm-level distortions using enterprise survey micro-data. The core of our innovation is to explicitly model the firms' decisions to report in the survey the distortions they face. Our second contribution is to apply our method across seven countries to characterize the distribution of these distortions and estimate the gross domestic product (GDP) loss induced by distortionary red tape. Our estimates are based on a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms whose capital investment decisions are distorted by red tape. We find that the aggregate cost of red tape varies widely across the countries in our dataset, with an average cost of 0.8% of annual GDP. Our framework opens up a new range of applications for enterprise surveys in macro-financial modeling and policy analysis.

 of how initially positive design intentions of AI tools result in negative consequences. • Managers' behaviors, beliefs and goals are crucial in shaping AI outcomes and can trigger the devolution of AI tools' positive implementation to their negative consequences. • To prevent the misuse of AI tools through managers, it is essential to involve both managers and workers in the design and implementation process. 

The paper titled 'a dynamic perspective on software modularity in open source software (oss) development: a configurational approach.' discusses: To reduce technical and task interdependencies, modularization has been considered important in OSS development. However, the existing literature implicitly takes a static view that software structure and organizational structure are established early on and change slowly over time, if at all. Such a view does not fully reflect the complex and dynamic nature of software development and tends to overlook the role played by human agents as they ramp involvement up and down over time. This study considers that coordination practice plays an important role in altering technical interdependencies in OSS development. This study investigates coordination practices that result in changes in software coupling—in particular, increases in software coupling. This study automatically analyzes the code in 72 software releases and 1033 task episodes of three successful OSS projects—GNU grep, IPython, and Scikit-image.
