-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

The paper titled 'can we make middle age less miserable?' discusses: The article recommends several books and a podcast that offer insight on issues pertinent to middle-aged professionals. The book, 'Hags' by Victoria Smith and 'Revolting Women' by Lucy Ryan offers insightful stories, advice and inspiration for older women, as does the podcast 'Wiser than Me' hosted by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The book 'Learning to Love Midlife' by Chip Conley details the struggles of midlife from a male perspective. Karen Walrond's 'Radiant Rebellion' likewise promotes the idea of aging gracefully, with midlife being a time for personal evolution.

The paper titled 'the gender gap in phd entrepreneurship: why balancing employment in academia really matters.' discusses: We use original data from a questionnaire survey of 9062 individuals enrolled in PhD programmes in Italy between 2008 and 2014 to conduct an empirical investigation of gender issues in PhD entrepreneurship. The analysis focuses on the influence of the gender balance among academics at the parent university, to measure the opportunities available to female students to engage with same-sex role models and the effect of such engagement on female students' attitudes to applied research and entrepreneurship. Our evidence shows that there is a gender gap in PhD

 Consistent with firms avoiding costly regulation, we document significant bunching around three major regulatory thresholds. Estimations reveal that the three examined rules' compliance costs range from 1.2% to 1.8% of market capitalization for firms near thresholds. For a median U.S. public company, total costs amount to 4.3% of market capitalization, and at least 2.3% absent regulatory avoidance frictions. These cost estimates are robust across various extrapolation assumptions, ranging from 2.1% to 6.3% of market capitalization. Regulatory costs have a greater impact on private firms' IPO decisions than on public firms' going private decisions, but such costs only explain a small part of the decline in the number of public firms. 

The paper titled 'what can business learn from art?' discusses: An essay is presented which explores the intersection of art and business, urging readers to consider the value of understanding the artistic process in achieving success. Through insights from various books and a TV show, the article emphasizes the importance of learning from the arts, highlighting parallels between artistic creation and business enterprise. It suggests that true accomplishment, akin to the craftsmanship found in art, can elevate business pursuits beyond mere achievement. The author concludes by advocating

 for a shift towards a focus on meaningful endeavors in the corporate world.

The paper titled 'universal basic income: a dynamic assessment.' discusses: Universal basic income (UBI) is an increasingly popular policy proposal, but there is no evidence regarding its longer-term consequences. We find that UBI generates large welfare losses in a general equilibrium model with imperfect capital markets, labor market shocks, and intergenerational linkages via skill formation and transfers. This conclusion is robust to various alternative ways of financing UBI. By using observationally equivalent models that eliminate different sources of endogenous dynamic linkages (equilibrium capital market and parental investment in child skills), we show that the latter are largely responsible for the negative welfare consequences. (JEL H24, H31, I38, J22, J24, J62) 

The paper titled 'persuading skeptics and fans in the presence of additional information.' discusses: We consider the information design problem of a demand-maximizing firm launching a product of unknown quality to a market consisting of customers who have heterogeneous prior beliefs about quality. The firm publicly discloses information about quality to all customers. These customers can subsequently opt to acquire additional information about the product at a cost from sources beyond the firm's control. Our study is
