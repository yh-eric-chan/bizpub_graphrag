-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

Text:
The paper titled 'understanding consumer self-design abandonment: a dynamic perspective.' discusses: Many studies have found that allowing customers to self-design products using customization configurators generates high value for customers. However, in practice, high abandonment rates cast doubt on these findings. In the present article, this contradiction is resolved by analyzing consumers' experiences during the creative process. Six studies provide converging evidence that consumers abandon customization because their valence during the process is U-shaped: initial high expectations prompt consumers to start self-designing in the first place, but they quickly find, to their frustration, that their (interim) design solutions are less attractive and the self-designing process is less enjoyable than they originally anticipated. Unaware that their enjoyment of the process would ultimately increase if they persisted through this phase, they abandon the self-design process altogether. It is only if the consumer overcomes the minimum of the U of valence that they harness the potential value from self-designing. This problematic pattern can be managed by providing social feedback during the self-design process. These findings contribute not only to the customization literature but also more generally to the understanding of consumers' goal pursuit by enhancing its scope to creative tasks.

Text:
The paper titled 'recursive importance sketching for rank constrained least squares: algorithms and high-order convergence.' discusses: Solving Rank Constrained Least Squares via Recursive Importance Sketching In statistics and machine learning, we sometimes run into the rank-constrained least squares problems, for which we need to find the best low-rank fit between sets of data, such as trying to figure out what factors are affecting the data, filling in missing information, or finding connections between different sets of data. This paper introduces a new method for solving this problem called the recursive importance sketching algorithm (RISRO), in which the central idea is to break the problem down into smaller, easier parts using a unique technique called "recursive importance sketching." This new method is not only easy to use, but it is also very efficient and gives accurate results. We prove that RISRO converges in a local quadratic-linear and quadratic rate under some mild conditions. Simulation studies also demonstrate the superior performance of RISRO. In this paper, we propose a recursive importance sketching algorithm for rank-constrained least squares optimization (RISRO). The key step of RISRO is recursive importance sketching, a new sketching framework based on deterministically designed recursive projections, and it significantly differs from the randomized sketching in the literature. Several existing algorithms in the literature can be reinterpreted under this new sketching framework, and RISRO offers clear advantages over them. RISRO is easy to implement and computationally efficient, and the core procedure in each iteration is to solve a dimension-reduced least squares problem. We establish the local quadratic-linear and quadratic rate of convergence for RISRO under some mild conditions. We also discover a deep connection of RISRO to the Riemannian Gauss–Newton algorithm on fixed rank matrices. The effectiveness of RISRO is demonstrated in two applications in machine learning and statistics: low-rank matrix trace regression and phase retrieval. Simulation studies demonstrate the superior numerical performance of RISRO. Funding: Y. Luo and A. Zhang were partially supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant CAREER-2203741]. W.

Text:
The paper titled 'financing the gig economy.' discusses: Unlike traditional firm production, gig economy workers provide their own physical capital. As a consequence, the low‐income households for whom gig economy opportunities are most valuable often borrow to participate. In the context of ride share, difference‐in‐difference analysis reveals increased vehicle purchases, borrowing, utilization, and employment around entry, but financially constrained individuals cannot participate. To assess the equilibrium importance of financing, I build and estimate a structural model of the gig economy. Access to finance proves critical for the gig economy's growth: without finance, equilibrium quantities would be 40% lower and prices 90% higher, and only higher‐income households could participate as drivers.
